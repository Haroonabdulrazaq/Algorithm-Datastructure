This is a repo for my Hackerrank Challenges.

I'm using this to practice my coding skills and to prepare for technical interviews.

I'm also using this to improve my problem solving skills.

I started a challenge on LinkedIn to solve 100 problems in 100 days.

Todays is Day 50, and I would like to post my thought and my approach to the problems to each problem.
